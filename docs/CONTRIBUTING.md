# Contributing (Public Preview)

Thanks for your interest! This project has a public preview and a closed‑core Pro edition.

- Public preview: issues and small PRs for UI/UX fixes and docs are welcome.
- Pro code/assets are private and not open to contribution at this time.

Guidelines
- Keep changes focused and test‑covered (`npm test`).
- Avoid introducing dependencies that increase bundle size without clear benefit.
- Be kind. We’re building tools for humans.

How to run
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
npm test
```
