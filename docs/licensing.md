# Licensing

This project ships in two forms:

- Public preview (open docs + shell UI): You can read docs, run the preview, and open issues.
- Pro (commercial, closed‑core): Source and assets are private; distributed to licensed users only under a commercial EULA.

Key points
- Pro code, assets (villain scripts, FX overlays, analytics HUD, premium GIFs/video) are NOT open‑source.
- You may not redistribute, sublicense, or reverse‑engineer Pro components.
- Public preview code may include stubs and test helpers but omits the proprietary logic and content.

Files
- `LICENSE-commercial.txt` — commercial EULA (end‑user license terms)
- `licenses/` — any third‑party licenses and notices

Pro source and assets are fully closed. No BSL or open-source license applies to Pro code or content. All rights reserved.
