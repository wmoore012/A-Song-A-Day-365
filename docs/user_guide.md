# THE NUKES — User Guide

Welcome! This is a focused, daily practice tool. Keep it simple, keep it moving.

## Basics
- Start a session with “Start Work” (7:00 latency target).
- Mark Done when you ship something (even a rough loop). Streak + heat map update.
- Tap HEAT buttons during the session to mark what’s 🔥.

## Villain
- The villain is your competitive voice. You’ll see occasional taunts and tips.
- Messages animate like a neon console. If you prefer instant messages, we can switch it off.

## Audio
- “Enable Sound” arms audio once. White noise and vibes are optional; pick your own.

## Analytics (Pro)
- Cinematic HUD charts appear as you scroll. Streak momentum, multiplier gauge, and more.

## GIF announces (Pro)
- Short framed GIF cards pop for Start, Done, and awards.
- Defaults: we ship curated pools. You can also use GIPHY (optional) if enabled.
- Don’t overthink it: click the big blue “Just use Default” button to auto‑apply a great set.
  - The chooser will collapse out of your way.

## Locker (Pro)
- View your awards and rare drops in a glass locker. “Go to Locker” will scroll you there.

## Tips
- If you stall: lower the bar, make 8 bars, bounce.
- Keep session friction low. Tiny wins add up.
- Title your work (even a working title) to reduce friction later.

## Privacy & licensing
- Pro content (scripts, FX, premium assets) is closed‑core. Don’t redistribute.

That’s it: small steps, every day. Ship it.
