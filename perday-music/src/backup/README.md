# Backup Components

## SafeApp.tsx
**Purpose**: Minimal fallback component for emergency recovery

**When to use**:
- If main App.tsx fails to render due to critical errors
- If Zustand store hydration completely breaks
- If you need a guaranteed-working minimal interface

**To restore**:
```bash
# Move back to main source
mv src/backup/SafeApp.tsx src/
# Update main.tsx to import SafeApp instead of App
# Then restart dev server
```

**Current Status**: Not needed - main App.tsx is fully functional with all tests passing.
